Medical Insurance Trend Analyzer
The Medical Insurance Trend Analyzer is a machine learning project designed to analyze and predict future trends in medical insurance costs. This project leverages machine learning models, such as Linear Regression and Random Forest, to explore how different factors like age, BMI, and smoking status affect insurance charges. The goal is not to predict exact costs but to provide insights into future trends, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.
